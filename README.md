## install dependencies

You only need to install dependencies for the python script. The prebuild binary comes bundled with everything!

A virtual environment is recommended, but optional:

1. Set up the venv:

```
python -m venv .venv
```

2. Activate it:

```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Done!
